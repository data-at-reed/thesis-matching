The phenomenon identified is that the older the macaques are, the larger the enlarged perivascular spaces are, leading to signs of aging and potential markers of cognitive impairment.

For the second part, given the results of the imaging, I would look at regions in the basal ganglia and white matter to see if structure and function change with aging and changes in cognitive function with those respective regions would translate to a human model since previous research has shown that volume changes occur in perivascular spaces in humans as well—looking at critical markers in the brain that lead to aging and given the history of all the primates, such as body condition score and activity levels that would supplement what we know about age and the volume of perivascular spaces, to identify any correlations to age and life function at different stages.

The SCALP lab is known in the consciousness science community for rigorous experimental designs and extremely clean EEG data, making many past (and current) experiments excellent candidates for re-analysis using computational methods like decoding and functional integration to parse NCCs or other interesting neural correlates. Decoding is a method of differentiating neural signals based on the experimental trial conditions using historically linear methods and more recently machine learning methods such as neural nets—successful decoding can be reverse engineered to cue researchers to meaningful elements of the neural signal. Functional integration or functional connectivity is a method based on information theory that can be used to relate the signals of different electrodes to each other to find causal or mutual relationships that reflect the underlying flow of information in the brain; both of these methods would be approached programmatically, probably with MATLAB.
",,"Develop a Multimodality Protein Interaction and Activity Graph (Bivalent, Weighted, and Directed) - with Anna Ritz
Having worked with protein interaction graphs at Reed and at UCSF, one of the biggest limitations is the unreliability and extreme level of abstraction edges in the graph are from the conceptual interaction between a ‘regulating’ protein and the altered level of function in an ‘effector’ protein (‘regulating’ and ‘effector’ being relative to each other and the research question being asked). Whether the goal is to better interpret the results of an omics data technique, look at the downstream effects/implications of a targeted experiment like a knock-out, or to predict important regulators in silico, having a protein interaction graph with 1.) edges that reflect the weighted effects of one protein’s activity on another protein’s activity across multiple modalities of transcriptional, translational, post-translational, allosteric, and other kinds of regulation, as well as 2.) complex nodes that can track PTM sites or logical interactions (ex: increased activity of multiple subunits is required for an enzymatic complex’s function => effect on another protein) would be a veritably omnipotent model for perturbances in the cell. Such a model is obviously not currently possible (and has many confounding elements not discussed here like cell differentiation and perturbations by disease), but leveraging the many virtual databases of protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, transcription factor-operon relationships, complex formation, phosphorylation by kinases, ubiquitination and other small peptide ligases, and so on might begin to make a more nuanced and predictive model that can account for direction, magnitude, and valence of gene/protein’s effects on other proteins’ activity. Programming would probably be done mostly in Python; toy models especially might be easier to develop in Jupyter Notebooks/rMarkdown using a combination of R, Python, bash, and javascript.

",,"Given that cyanolichens, particularly the algal partner nostoc, fix nitrogen from the environment into the lichen as a whole and there has been consideration a a threshold at which the lichens can no longer fix nitrogen: what is the difference in the nitrogen fixation ability in cyanolichens found in urban areas, with higher amounts of nitrogen pollution in the air, and rural more insulated areas. Additionally, how does this rate differ in a dry season and wet season given that nutrient leaching can additionally limit the amount of nutrients that the nostoc can fix. Thus, how does the nitrogen fixation ability of cyanolichens nostoc differ as a result of nitrogen saturation and leaching as cofactors.

So my goal is to investigate the presence of interferon-lambda and other cytokine in the breast milk through bio-sensing system.

One strategy involves the utilization of high-affinity ABC transporters, specialized membrane proteins that import Mn(II) and Zn(II) into bacterial cells. In this project, I aim at exploring why these ABC transporters (MntABC and ZnuABC) have such high selectivity for Mn and Zn using cryo-EM and crystallography. ",

In particular, I would like to investigate differences between the motivation and stress of “neurodivergent” students and “neurotypical” students at different times throughout the school year. Common neurodiverse conditions, such as ADHD, ASD, etc. are known to cause difficulties in academic settings, so I would like to examine the connection between neurodiversity, motivation, and stress. I would also like to possibly frame this with examining students’ “stress mindset,” which Jennifer describes as “the extent to which stress is perceived as either debilitating or invigorating.” I would plan on covering the neuroscience component more in the introduction and discussion than with an empirical neuroscience component. I would also reach out to professors in the neuroscience department as consultants to help with making a connection between my data and the neuroscience behind it.

A second idea revolves around the mental load of motherhood. From some of my searching online about this topic, I’ve seen several references to what is described as invisible work and cognitive labor, which can include anything that one has to keep track of to keep the household running, such as doctor’s appointments, birthdays, food preferences, and more. I would like to propose an investigation of the effects of this continuous invisible work on stress levels and cognition at different stages of mastrescence. There are certainly some specifics that need to be worked out with this project, but I think there are many different and interesting approaches I could take to this. For example, looking for a correlation between mental load/stress and attachment, or a correlation between different factors associated with motherhood (difficulties in childbirth, invisible labor/cognitive load, stressors both and home and work, etc.) and mood disorders.

Matthew described that in his lab, when they go through the procedure of schedule-induced polydipsia with the rats, they find individual differences in the behavioral responses, with some rats exhibiting a high response to SIP, and some a low response, which indicates a spectrum of individual expressions of compulsivity. We discussed taking this idea of differences in expressions of compulsivity and looking for correlations between a compulsive behavioral phenotype and other behaviors related to compulsivity/impulsivity. If there is a correlation between the phenotype and other behaviors related to compulsivity (possibly using other behavioral tasks in rats that serve as models for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and other disorders), it might suggest biological mechanisms in common.
