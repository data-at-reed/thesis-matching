joekbush@reed.edu,Joe Bush,20025012,Chem,"I would like to pursue a project that I started this summer at Rutgers during my REU in the Lipke group. I plan to synthesize a terpyridine-based bischromium oligomer (6+) that we can study the electrochemical properties of to provide insight for the electronic structure of larger, more complex metallopolymers. I will need to carry out a multi-step synthesis to prepare the two ligands, which will combine air-free techniques with organic and inorganic reactions. As for characterization, I will use 1H-NMR for proof of purity and grow crystals for single-crystal XRD (SCXRD) for proof of structure. Interestingly, the 1H-NMR can not effectively be used for characterization as the two chromium centers are paramagnetic in this specific oxidation state (3+ each), thus broadening certain signals due to altered relaxation times. Instead, I plan to use it to check off for paramagnetic features and to see if there is any diamagnetic features remaining (unreacted ligand). For electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization I will combine cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV-vis near-IR (UV-vis-NIR) of the various reduced states (5+, 4+, 3+, 2+, which will be accessed by stoichiometric treatments of Cp2Co). 

I have already collected CV and UV-vis-NIR data but have yet to be able to characterize the majority of the features due to the lack of comparative data from similar chemical systems. For this thesis, I plan to collect the data again and attempt to identify the first few redox states of the oligomer using a combination of CV, UV-vis-NIR, and SCXRD of the reduced states. Past papers about similar terpyridine-based systems suggest structural changes as a result of an electron being added (reduction) to the system. I plan to investigate this by collecting SCXRD data of the various reduced states. 

Next, I plan to also collect CV and UV-vis-NIR data of similar bischromium systems, specifically by replacing specific redox-active units for redox-inactive units. Then I could observe which electrochemical or spectroscopic features are preserved or which ones are not. Either outcome could hint towards which redox-active units are responsible for which of the electronic or spectroscopic features. 

Lastly, I just recently thought of this, but I could also consider exploring density functional theory (DFT) calculations of this bischromium system and its reduced states. I understand that DFT sometimes has trouble performing calculations with multiple radicals in the system (introduces a ton more variables) but I think it is worth a shot. This could also be a chance to learn DFT.

The thesis will utilize and adjust the paradigm in which rats are given two options testing their desire for environmental information. Firstly, an informational option in which they will hear a tone that tells them decisively whether or not they will get a food reward. Secondly, a non-informative option in which the rat has a 50% chance of getting more food than in the first option, thus rats are biased towards the non-information option.

This study could be done in humans, as in the past, or in rats with the advanced learning apparatus being developed. 

Secondly, I am also very interested in studying people's responses to “closing the loop.” Once people learn an order it is very hard to add loops and caveats within that cycle. A previously linearly established order can be manipulated in several ways, either by making it into an ouroboros where the last item is better than the first item or by adding small loops within the larger order. Overall the goal of this research would be to better understand how people's ability to classify items or learn is affected by adding new orders to existing hierarchies.
",,"For the Zornik lab I propose a thesis where I look at how different hormonal conditions generate different vocal patterns in female African clawed frogs. This would build off of a past thesis which looked at how frogs treated with testosterone are able to produce male vocal sounds (Steele, 2018). We could utilize hormones such as serotonin, or further explore testosterone, to elicit different calls in female frogs and use electroencephalography to better understand these vocal patterns in the brain. This project would involve both behavioral and physiology testing. 

Ultimately, I am very interested in using hormones to better understand sex differences in a African clawed frogs, and I am open to several courses of research to approach this topic.
